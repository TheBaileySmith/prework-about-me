      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a process engineer with over 20 years of experience working with fortune 500, 100 and 50 companies to assist teams to work smarter, not harder. I'm passionate about working with program, project and product frameworks in the context of business constraints to drive innovation in team, department and organizational transformations.</p><br><p>Today's CIO's and CTO's look to see their process leaders to deepen their technical capabilities to better partner with their technical leaders for greater synergies. I look forward to expanding my capabilities in the UW Coding Boot Camp for just that purpose</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a down-home boy from the mid-western United States, I'm tried to keep true to the values my family instilled in me as I've prusued my wonderlust and traveled the world. I've lived in over 11 states and three countries and visited 37 countries and counting. Arts, culture and food pull me to new horizons as often as I can and I enjoy incoporating the diversity of the world into my home whenever I can. I've grateful that my Australian husband shares my passion for travel and new cultures and new experiences.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a bit of a renaissance man, if I do say so myself, so there are few things that I won't try. But my core hobbies are probably:
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling</li>
          <li>Scuba Diving</li>
          <li>Gardening</li>
          <li>Writing Fantasy & Sci-Fi</li>
          <li>Civil Rights Activism</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Does anyone actually have just one dream job? Lately I have a passion for Real Estate. But not just buying and selling. I want to refurbish homes. Bring old, worn out places back to the life and glory they once held. Honor their past, while bringing them up into the present for a new generation to enjoy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have just joined my extended family in the Pacific North West. I've had family up in the state of Washington since it was a territory and I have recently joined my hundreds of cousins in the greater Seattle area and settled in rual beautiful rual town of Enumclaw. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I don't. I want to deepen my technical knowledge to increase my ability to partner with engineers and developers in my technical organizational transformation work. I also have a few side projects I'm intrested in prusing as a side hobby and would like to DIY them rather than hire a web developer for v1 of these projects.</p>
